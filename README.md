# Flappy Capybara
## Background and Overview
Flappy Capybara is a clone of the popular game Flappy Bird, where the main objective is navigate a flying Capybara to go through pairs of pipes and travel as far as possible. The number of pipes passed is kept as the score, and will be displayed as an alert upon game over.

## Features
The player controls a capybara that becomes animated upon game start. A background is set to scroll continuously in the background to imitate the sense of travelling, while a click will give the capybara a boost of vertical speed. Custom drawn pipes will be generated after a set amount of warmup time for the player to begin navigating through.
